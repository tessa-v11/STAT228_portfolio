## Site Purpose

This site is meant to showcase ym work as I build projects and learn new skills through an Introduction To Data Science course. Here you will find a collection of mini projects from this course where I learn and apply various data science techniques within R. This portfolio is a reflection of my growht as I aim to deepen my knowledge of programming and data analysis.

## Projects

### MiniProject 1

**Summary**: This project served to practice data anlysis and visualization on a real dataset using R. This project explores whether certain categorical traits — like a player’s name, birth date, or nationality — are more common among NHL players. Using data from 3,000+ players active between 2008–2023, I looked for trends that might give future hockey parents a competitive edge. The results revealed that NHL players from hockey-centric countries and born early in the year (especially February) are most common.

### Mini Project 2

**Summary**: The goal of this project was to create a tutorial to introduce beginners to data wrangling techniques. I explored essential data transformation techniques such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and summarizing data using the `dplyr` package and the built-in `diamonds` dataset from the `ggplot2` package. The tutorial also incorporated visualizations, including box plots and scatter plots, to highlight how wrangling data can uncover insights. Overall, this project provided a practical introduction to transforming raw data into a clean, organized format ready for analysis, laying the groundwork for more advanced data science tasks.
